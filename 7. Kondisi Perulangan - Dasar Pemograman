1.Buatlah program untuk membalik sebuah kalimat, misal: input : “LUPA-LUPA INGAT” output : “TAGNI APUL-APUL”?


- Here is a Python program to reverse a sentence word by word:
python
# Input a sentence
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# Split the sentence into words
words = sentence.split()

# Reverse each word in the list
for i in range(len(words)):
    words[i] = words[i][::-1]

# Join the reversed words to form a new sentence
new_sentence = " ".join(words)

# Display the new sentence
print("Reversed sentence: ", new_sentence)

In this program, we first prompt the user to input a sentence and store it in a variable called sentence.
We then split the sentence into words using the split() method and store them in a list called words.
We then loop through each word in the list and reverse it using slicing and assignment. Finally,
we join the reversed words using the join() method and display the new sentence using a print() statement.

2. Buatlah program untuk menghitung jumlah masing-masing huruf vokal, dengan output seperti berikut ini:
kalimat : “Universitas Nusa Putera”
output :
    Jumlah huruf A = 3
    Jumlah huruf I =  2
    Jumlah huruf U = 3
    Jumlah huruf E = 2
    Jumlah huruf O = 0
    Total jumlah huruf vokal = 10?


- Here is a Python program to count the number of each vowel in a sentence:
python
# Input a sentence
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# Make it suitable for caseless comparisons
sentence = sentence.casefold()

# Define vowels
vowels = 'aeiou'

# Initialize a dictionary with each vowel as its key and all values equal to 0
count = {}.fromkeys(vowels, 0)

# Loop through each character in the sentence and increment the count of the corresponding vowel in the dictionary if it is a vowel
for char in sentence:
    if char in count:
        count[char] += 1

# Print the count of each vowel
for vowel, num in count.items():
    print("Jumlah huruf", vowel.upper(), "=", num)

# Print the total count of vowels
total = sum(count.values())
print("Total jumlah huruf vokal =", total)

In this program, we first prompt the user to input a sentence and store it in a variable called sentence.
We then make the sentence suitable for caseless comparisons using the casefold() method.
We define a string called vowels containing all the vowels. We then initialize a dictionary called count with each vowel
as its key and all values equal to 0 using the fromkeys() method. We loop through each character in the sentence using a for loop.
In each iteration, we check if the character is a vowel by checking if it is in the count dictionary keys. If it is,
we increment the value by 1. Finally,
we print the count of each vowel using a for loop and print the total count of vowels using the sum() function.
